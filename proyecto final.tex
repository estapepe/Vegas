\abstract{In this project we create an intelligent system to determine what is the best heuristic to win at Las Vegas Board Game.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:1}
We want to program an intelligent system able to play the game with different heuristics. With the information of the winners we will determine what is the best strategy in order to win at Las Vegas Board Game.
The system should consider all the rules of the game and the different heuristics that we program.

\subsection{Rules of the game}
The game consists in 5 players trying to collect as much money as possible from the casinos. Set for each round:\begin{itemize}
\item{The banknotes are placed in each casino until they have at least 50,000.}
\item{Each player will have 8 dices of one color.}
\end{itemize}In your turn roll all your dices and select a set of dice with a single number. Put that set in the corresponding casino. When you run out of dice, pass your turn.On each casino the player with the most dice receives the highest banknote. In case there are more banknotes, the second place receives the next high banknote and so on.The game continues for 4 rounds and the winner is the player with the most money. In case of a tie, the winner is the player with the most banknotes.

\section{Hypothesis}
\label{sec:2}

We believe that executing a fair amount of simulations of a game match will give us enough data. The data will determine if there is an statistically significant bias in the amount of times each match is win by a player using a particular heuristic. This will tell us if the use of that particular heuristic is translated in a better chance to win.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:3}

We modeled each component of the game as an object, using the Python programming language. Included in this objects there's a configurable Player. Each player is configured once at the beginning of the match, and remains with the same configuration until the match ends and the game evaluates the outcome to determine a winner.

In our experiments, the game and players remain in the same configuration during each replica of the experiment. Each replica of the experiment consists of one match, each experiment consists of a given number of replicas, the result of each match consist of the evaluation of the last state at which the game is at the moment that all of the players run out of dice. The discrete unit which changes the state of the game is the turn, at each turn only one player changes the state of the game, a round consists of exactly one turn for each player taken in the same order in every round, a match consists of as many rounds as needed for the all the players to be left with no dice. If a player has run out of dice when its turn comes, the state of the game after its turn will be the same as before its turn. The result of the experiment is a set of tuples, one for each replica. Each tuple contains data taken from the evaluation the game executes at the end of every match and is composed as follows:

\begin{equation}
y = \{x1, x2, ..., xn\}
\end{equation}

Where xi is the amount of game money the player i is assigned in the final evaluation. For the purpose of analyzing the data, these values where normalized in two ways:

\begin{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item{x'i is 1 if xi is max(x1, x2, ..., xn), 0 }
\item{otherwise: y' = y/|y|}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In our experiments there are 5 players with each using a different heuristic.

We determined that, once every other element of the game is set and initialized, the fundamental operation that determines the outcome of a match is the player's decision at each turn to relinquish one subset of dice from the set of all the dice it possesses, this set is partitioned in subsets that have dice with the same top face for the current turn (the player rolls the dice once each turn). Hence our heuristics are nothing but a way for the player to choose which subset of dice to relinquish each turn.

\section{Experimantation}
\label{sec:4}

\subsection{Heuristics}
\begin{description}[Type 1]
\item[Alpha]{This heuristic will choose the set of dices with the highest amount of dices.}
\item[Bravo]{This one will choose the casino with the highest banknote in order to get at least one high prize.}
\item[Charlie]{It will choose the casino with the most banknotes, so it will make sure to receive something.}
\item[Delta]{It will try to outnumber an opponent in a casino}
\item[Echo]{It will try to match an opponent so that neither of them will win the prize.}

\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:2}
% Always give a unique label
% and use \ref{<label>} for cross-references
% and \cite{<label>} for bibliographic references
% use \sectionmark{}
% to alter or adjust the section heading in the running head
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your
cross-references and citations.

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

Use the standard \verb|equation| environment to typeset your equations, e.g.
%
\begin{equation}
a \times b = c\;,
\end{equation}
%
however, for multiline equations we recommend to use the \verb|eqnarray| environment\footnote{In physics texts please activate the class option \texttt{vecphys} to depict your vectors in \textbf{\itshape boldface-italic} type - as is customary for a wide range of physical subjects}.
\begin{eqnarray}
a \times b = c \nonumber\\
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}=\vec{c}
\label{eq:01}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Subsection Heading}
\label{subsec:2}
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your
cross-references\index{cross-references} and citations\index{citations}
as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

\begin{quotation}
Please do not use quotation marks when quoting texts! Simply use the \verb|quotation| environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout.
\end{quotation}


\subsubsection{Subsubsection Heading}
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your
cross-references and citations as has already been described in
Sect.~\ref{subsec:2}, see also Fig.~\ref{fig:1}\footnote{If you copy
text passages, figures, or tables from other works, you must obtain
\textit{permission} from the copyright holder (usually the original
publisher). Please enclose the signed permission with the manucript. The
sources\index{permission to print} must be acknowledged either in the
captions, as footnotes or in a separate section of the book.}

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

% For figures use
%
\begin{figure}[b]
\sidecaption
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
% For example, with the graphicx style use
\includegraphics[scale=.65]{figure}
%
% If no graphics program available, insert a blank space i.e. use
%\picplace{5cm}{2cm} % Give the correct figure height and width in cm
%
\caption{If the width of the figure is less than 7.8 cm use the \texttt{sidecaption} command to flush the caption on the left side of the page. If the figure is positioned at the top of the page, align the sidecaption with the top of the figure -- to achieve this you simply need to use the optional argument \texttt{[t]} with the \texttt{sidecaption} command}

When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
